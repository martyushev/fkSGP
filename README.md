# Forward kinematics of a general Stewart-Gough platform

A Stewart-Gough platform (SGP) is a type of parallel manipulator used in various applications including flight simulators, robotic manipulators, haptic devices, surgical robots, radio telescopes, etc. The SGP consists of a fixed base and a movable platform connected by six extensible legs. Each leg is connected to both the base and the platform through spherical joints, allowing for a wide range of motion, see Figure. The lengths of the legs are typically controlled by actuators, such as hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, which can extend or retract the legs.

The forward kinematics problem for a Stewart-Gough platform involves determining the position and orientation of the movable platform given the lengths of the six extensible legs and the internal geometries of the platform and base. This problem is inherently complex due to the parallel structure of the platform, which results in a system of non-linear equations.

This repository contains the MATLAB/Julia/Python implementations of the elimination template based solution to the forward kinematics problem for a <em>general</em> SGP. The solvers have been generated by the automatic solver generator from https://github.com/martyushev/eliminationTemplates.
